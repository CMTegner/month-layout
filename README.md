# calendar-loop

Utility that makes creating visual representations of calendar months a bit less painful.

## Examples

```javascript
import loop from 'calendar-loop'

loop({ year: 2016, month: 5 })
```

The output of the example above will be:

```javascript
[
  [-1, -1, -1,  1,  2,  3,  4],
  [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10, 11],
  [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18],
  [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25],
  [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, -1, -1]
]
```

Here's how you might use it to build a calendar:

```javascript
const weeks = loop({ year: 2016, month: 2 })

weeks.reduce((rows, week) => {
  return `${rows}<div>${week.reduce((cells, day) => {
    return `${cells}<span>${day > -1 ? day : ''}</span>`
  }, '')}</div>`
}, '')
```

Which will return:

```html
<div>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
  <span>1</span>
  <span>2</span>
  <span>3</span>
  <span>4</span>
  <span>5</span>
</div>
<div>
  <span>6</span>
  <span>7</span>
  <span>8</span>
  <span>9</span>
  <span>10</span>
  <span>11</span>
  <span>12</span>
</div>
<div>
  <span>13</span>
  <span>14</span>
  <span>15</span>
  <span>16</span>
  <span>17</span>
  <span>18</span>
  <span>19</span>
</div>
<div>
  <span>20</span>
  <span>21</span>
  <span>22</span>
  <span>23</span>
  <span>24</span>
  <span>25</span>
  <span>26</span>
</div>
<div>
  <span>27</span>
  <span>28</span>
  <span>29</span>
  <span>30</span>
  <span>31</span>
  <span></span>
  <span></span>
</div>
```

Add some (conditional) styling and you're in business!

## API

### loop(options: object): Array<Array<number>>

`options` must contain at least `year: number` and `month: number`. Note that `month` is zero-based, so January is `0`, February is `1`, and so on. This choice was made to mirror [`new Date(year, month)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date). You can also provide `startOfWeek: number` to determine which weekday should be used as the first. Sunday is `0` (default), and Monday is `1` (these are the only two supported atm.). Again, this was done to mirror [`Date#getDay()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getDay). `calendar-loop` exports two enums so you don't have to remember the numbers: `import loop, { SUNDAY, MONDAY } from 'calendar-loop'`.

The return value is a two-dimensional array of numbers. `-1` should be treated as a day belonging to the previous/next month, render accordingly.
